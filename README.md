# Dreamhost hook for letsencrypt.sh ACME client

This a hook for the [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) ACME client [letsencrypt.sh](https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh), that enables using DNS records on [Dreamhost](https://www.dreamhost.com/) to respond to `dns-01` challenges. Requires your Dreamhost API key being in the environment.

## Setup
```
$ git clone https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh
$ cd letsencrypt.sh
$ mkdir hooks
$ git clone https://github.com/ErinMorelli/letsencrypt-dreamhost-hook hooks/dreamhost
$ pip install -r hooks/dreamhost/requirements.txt
$ export DREAMHOST_API_KEY='K9uX2HyUjeWg5AhAb'
```

Get your Dreamhost API key by logging in to your control panel, and navigating to the [Web Panel API page](https://panel.dreamhost.com/index.cgi?tree=home.api). Make sure that the "All dns functions" option is checked before clicking on "Generate a new API Key now!".

## Usage

```
$ ./letsencrypt.sh -c -d example.com -t dns-01 -k 'hooks/dreamhost/hook.py'
